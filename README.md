# Flourometer

This repository contains everything related to the construction of a fluorometer, using a TCS230 color sensor.

Instructions

1. Plug The machine to a USB port, or a 9V batery or a 9 to 12 V wall adapter.
  - The machine should now be on the mode selection screen
  
2. Push the button to select which mode you wish to operate in

3. Follow onscreen instructions.As simple as that.

*****REMEMBER******

1. Modes in this machine are cyclical so if you for some reason messed up in some part of the procedure just press enter until you are in the end of the mode, after that simply choose a new mode with the buttons.

*****WHAT NOT TO DO******

1. Please do not plug it into the wall using a USB phone adapter since the voltage supplied might be to low and the fluorometer might stop working (In previous experiences we had to re upload the code to the arduino when we did this, so this probably erased the code in it).
